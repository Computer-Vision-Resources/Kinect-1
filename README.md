#Atos Origin Kinect
This Kinect application framework and demo apps are made by Marco Franssen and Jan Saris. During competence development at their company Atos Origin they started on februari 2011 by creating some apps and a framework with Microsoft Kinect. They started with a implementation in c#/WPF using the PrimeSense drivers and OpenNI SDK.

#Goal
Our goal is to create a framework for developers on top of Kinect. This Framework should support easy access to gestures etc. All the demo apps we created to test our framework are included. We would love it when you guys help to extend and improve the framework. Don't forget to add your own demo apps so you can show of all the cool stuff you made to the other developers participating.

#Installation
Need to add an installation manual here
